# UCB-Pseudosensor-Project-1

This is the first project required for Rapid Prototyping of Embedded Interface Designs (ECEA 5347) at the University of Colorado - Boulder. I have included a project summary pdf: UCB-Pseudosensor-Project1.pdf: This is a project overview, including requirements, assumptions, and other notes, as well as screenshots of the application in several scenarios.

Code is only available upon request to prevent plagiarism.

# What I learned

At the time I completed this project, I had a fair amount of time put into python coding so that made the process much more comfortable overall. On the other hand, I had not been introduced to Qt, nor PyQt5 prior to this project. My initial inclination was to code the UI from scratch, until I later learned that Qt Designer will do much of the heavy lifting for you if you have a general idea of what you want your UI to look like. 

Once your interface is designed in Qt Designer, much of the remaining work is to fine-tune visual parameters, and build the logic of the application (i.e. the fun part!). I can certainly see why Qt is a popular option for embedded design, due to relatively basic UIs as compared to front-end web development. This doesn't mean Qt isn't capable of aesthetically pleasing design, but one would be able to present a variety of designs for a client in a rather short period of time.
